| CrowdAnnotations Dataset Uploader |
 ----------------------------------

Description:

This utility is responsible for uploading datasets to CrowdAnnotations data stores.
Please note that you'll need a valid customer id and a secret token in order to authenticate to our systems.

It was written in Python 3.7.7 under CentOS with requirements detailed in requirements.txt and all sources at
the same directory as this README file for full visibility.

You may run the uploader.py file directly with Python or use our distrabution (i.e. CLI) at the sample folder as
this README file named ca_uploader.

In both cases, the API is similar.


API:

* Please use full instead of relative path when passing path as an argument.

arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CUSTOMER, --customer CUSTOMER
                        Your customer id
  -t TOKEN, --token TOKEN
                        Your customer secret token
  -n DATASET_NAME, --dataset-name DATASET_NAME
                        Name of dataset
  -p DATASET_PATH, --dataset-path DATASET_PATH
                        Local path to dataset
  -b BBOX_PATH, --bbox-path BBOX_PATH
                        Local path to bbox .json files, if applicable to the dataset
  -v, --verbose         For debugging


Verbosity:

The API above is verbose by default, and can be even more verbose with the -v command.
This is designed with the customer in mind and full visiblity on the process including all API calls.


Packaging:

The packaging code can be found at package/ directory. Using PyInstaller, we packaged the uploader.py for ease of usage.


Requirements:

Requirements provided in requirements.txt if using Python directly.
Packaging requirements provided in package/requirements.txt if packaging locally.
